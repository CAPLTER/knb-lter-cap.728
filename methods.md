We used the SOLWEIG model to estimate Mean Radiant Temperature (MRT). SOLWEIG requires three surface models — a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), a Building Surface Model (BSM), and a Canopy Digital Surface Model (CDSM) — along with meteorological forcing data. The surface models were generated from high-resolution LiDAR Point Cloud (LPC) data obtained from the USGS. Meteorological inputs, including air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and solar radiation, were sourced from the Phoenix Encanto weather station which is part of the AZMet network.

The DEM was derived from ground points only, while the BSM was generated by masking a full surface model with building footprints from Microsoft.  Non-building areas were filled with DEM values. The CDSM was created by subtracting the DEM from the full surface model for non-building pixels, with building pixels set to zero. All pixels with canopy heights less than or equal to 1.3 m were also set to zero, as they were not considered vegetation canopy. Direct and diffuse shortwave radiation components were estimated within SOLWEIG.
