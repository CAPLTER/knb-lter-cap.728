This dataset is a collection of 1-m resolution mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) rasters generated using digital surface models and the Solar and longwave environmental irradiance geometry (SOLWEIG) model. The dataset provides hourly Tmrt covering Maricopa County, Arizona (USA) metropolitan area for one of the hottest days in the summer of 2023 (July 19, 2023, peak air temperature of 44 degrees C) from 07:00 hrs to 20:00 hrs (Mountain Standard Time). The dataset is divided to cover these sub-spatial extents Maricopa Central (Anthem, Carefree, Cave Creek, Paradise Valley, Phoenix, Scottsdale, Tempe); Maricopa East (Chandler, Fountain Hills, Gilbert, Mesa, Queen Creek, Rio Verde, Sun Lakes); Maricopa West (Avondale, Buckeye, Citrus Park, El Mirage, Glendale, Goodyear, Litchfield Park, Peoria, Sun City, Sun City West, Surprise, Wickenburg, Youngtown).
